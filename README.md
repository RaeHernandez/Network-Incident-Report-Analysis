# DDoS Incident Report — NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

## 📘 Overview
This report analyzes a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that impacted a multimedia company’s network. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), I identified and addressed security gaps that led to the incident, and developed a strategy to strengthen the organization’s network defenses.

## 🧩 NIST CSF Functions Applied
**Identify:** Conducted internal network audit and found an unconfigured firewall rule.  
**Protect:** Implemented rate limiting and IP verification for ICMP traffic.  
**Detect:** Deployed network monitoring and IDS/IPS for abnormal traffic detection.  
**Respond:** Contained attack by disabling non-critical services and blocking ICMP flood.  
**Recover:** Restored critical systems and improved firewall configurations.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- Firewall configuration and rule management  
- IDS/IPS deployment  
- Network traffic monitoring  
- Incident response documentation
